# Classification of Handwritten Digits using K-Nearest-Neighbors in R

Data: A collection of handwritten numerical digits 

Model: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm classifies an observation based on the class labels of the k nearest observations in the training set (the “neighbors”). The classification power of k-nn depends on the choice of k and on the metric used to measure distance. Common
distance metrics include include Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distance.
